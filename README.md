This is hosted at [peers.bottled.codes](https://peers.bottled.codes) and allows for very simple peer reviews.

## Architecture

This is proof-of-concept usage of the [Swytch Framework](https://github.com/bottledcode/swytch-framework)
and [Durable PHP](https://github.com/bottledcode/durable-php).

Front-end components are in [src/Components](src/Components) and the model lives in [src/Model](src/Model).
